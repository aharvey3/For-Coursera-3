Introduction

Harvey would like to open up a BBQ restaurant in a district or neighborhood in Atlanta, Georgia U.S.A
and he is wondering about where would be the best place to do that based on customers interests. 

Business Problem 

To open up Harvey's BBQ place, we will need to analyze data about the neighborhoods in Atlanta.
We must make sure there aren't too many BBQ restaruants in the area so that we aren't competing with other interests, and we must keep in mind the 
economic and socioeconomics factors in place.
